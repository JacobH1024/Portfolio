## Board notes from March 8th (Wed)
Software Design:

1. Modularizing Decomposition
   The complexity is based on interrelationship between the modulars,
   not the number of lines of code.

2. Cohesion within a module is the degree to which communication takes place
   among the module's elements.
   Coupling describes the degree to which modules communicate with other modules.
   Goal:  maximize cohesion, minimize coupling

3. Frameworks
   A framework is a collection of classes that are usable by several different
   applications, e.g. the Java API.
   The core Java API packages are intended to serve huge ranges of applications.
