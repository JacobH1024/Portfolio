# 1. Invader Breakout
I started this project about a year and a half to two years ago
I wanted to create a game similar to Breakout (where you bounce a ball to break bricks) but with a new spin
You break bricks and enemyies come out and you have to shoot them to make things more interesting
I designed and created the game myself over a few months working on it in my free time
The game is written in java, all of the classes explain what they do if you want to take a look
# 2. University Website
I worked with a Team of 7 people in the spring of 2018 to create a mock university website
On the site you could see events, a calendar, and links to other parts of the site on the home page
From the site you could search and register for courses, search faculty, look on your schedule and even your grades
This website is written in java as well, I believe we used an Amazon server to host the site, MySQL to create the data bases, Gradle for build automation, we used Java Spark as our web framework, and the Apache Freemarker template engine to quickly stylize components
My Contribution
I put some of what I worked on in a folder called university website to make it easier to find.
I helped create the schema for the data tables. I was along with another student in charge of source control and deciding what to use (GitHub). I created the design for most of the website. I created, with another student, a source control guideline document and the user manual. I also remember creating a few tables and populating a lot of them with test data. I also remember making the homepage and another page that had something to do with searching or enrolling for courses but I do not remember exactly what. 
# 3. Small projects 
I have worked on many projects for school and I have put a few into this folder to show a few more things I have worked on.
